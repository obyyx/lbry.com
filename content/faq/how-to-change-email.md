In certain cases, you may want to change the email connected to your account. Changing email for Odysee.com and LBRY is actually process of merging accounts and deleting access from old one. You'll need to merge accounts yourself, by using the LBRY desktop app https://lbry.com/get

## Changing email on the desktop app
1. Sign in with the old email, and make sure that you have "Backup your account and wallet data" checked.
1. Sign out.
1. Sign in with the new email, and make sure that you have "Backup your account and wallet data" checked.
1. Your accounts are now merged. You can confirm this by login in to odysee.com with the new email. You should be able to control your channels from the new account.
1. Send email to us, and we will do the clean up on our side, moving verification status to the new email, deleting access from old email, etc.  
**Example:** "I've merged my accounts. Please delete the access from my old account \<old-email\> and move my verification status to the account \<new-email\>."

*Note:* To prevent users from causing harm to other users, we require the email to be sent from the **old email**.

### Important:
If you sign out of the LBRY desktop app and back in with a different email, **these wallets and accounts will be merged**. Do not do this unless it's intentional and you expect the new email to be used by the same person.

## Changing email on Android {#android}
**If you need to merge wallets, you need to backup/restore your Android wallet or use the LBRY Desktop app to merge them by signing into both emails. [Android wallet backup and restore instructions](https://lbry.com/faq/how-to-backup-wallet#android).**
